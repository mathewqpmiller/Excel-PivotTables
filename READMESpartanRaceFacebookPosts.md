Using the PivotTable created in the Spartan Race case study, complete the following:

Create a new view showing the # of Posts by Date of Post. On which date did Spartan Race post most often? What types of posts were they?

Which date showed the highest total engagement volume? Highest engagements per post? On the date with the highest engagements per post, which one drove the strongest response?

Create a new calculated field named "Sharability" (Shares / Total Engagements). Which post types tend to be most "sharable"? What time of day do people tend to share most?

Create a new calculated field named "Active Engagements" (Shares + Comments), then modify the formula to measure Active Engagements per Post. What time of day are users LEAST likely to actively engage with Spartan Race Facebook posts? How many active engagements per post during that time of day?
