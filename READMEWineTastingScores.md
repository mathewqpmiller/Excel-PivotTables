Using the PivotTable created in the Wine Tasting case study, complete the following:

Ungroup the price values, and create a new view showing the average point rating and average price with Subregion as row labels

Which subregion in the sample produced the highest-rated wines, on average?

Which subregion in the sample produced the highest-priced wines, on average?

Excluding blanks, which subregion has the most tastings recorded in the dataset?

Create a new view to show the average point ratings by Country (sorted descending by average points), and add a PivotChart to visualize the relative ratings as a Clustered Column Chart

On average, which country has generated the highest average ratings? The lowest?

How do the ratings compare across countries for Pinot Grigio varieties specifically?

Delete the PivotChart, then update your table to show the actual Wine Name for all Italian wines in the sample, along with the point rating and price

What's the cheapest Italian wine rated over 95 points?

Who reviewed that particular wine, and how did he/she describe it?
