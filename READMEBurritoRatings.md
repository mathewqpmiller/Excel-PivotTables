Create a NEW PivotTable from the San Diego Burrito Ratings data, and answer the following:

In your new PivotTable, compare average ratings for Tortilla, Temp, Fillings, Synergy, and Wrap Quality, by Location

Drag in the sum of the "# of Reviews" field and apply a value filter to only show locations with more than 2 ratings. How many locations recorded >2 ratings?

Create a calculated field named "Average Total Score", which correctly averages the five scores by location

Add a second instance of Average Total Score and show the values as a Rank (large to small) based on location. Among those with >2 reviews, which location is ranked #7?

Add a Color Scale to the Average Total Score field and sort descending. Which location has the lowest score? The highest?

Drag in Yelp Rating as an average, add a Color Scale, and compare against the Average Total Score field. How closely do the two fields align?
