Using the PivotTable created in the Apple App Data case study, complete the following:

Add a calculated column in the source data named "Volume", equal to "High" for rows where Total Ratings > 100,000 and "Low" otherwise

Clear the existing PivotTable and create a new view showing Volume as row labels, with the count of App Name and the sum of Total Ratings as values. How many apps are categorized as high-volume?

Update both fields to show values as % of Column Total. What percentage of all apps are high-volume, and what percentage of all ratings do those high-volume apps account for?

How do average ratings compare between high-volume and low-volume apps?

Pull in the App Name as secondary row labels, remove the Count of App Name field, and filter your view to show the Top 10 apps descending by Total Ratings.

Among high-volume apps, which 3 drove the most ratings?

Among apps where the primary genre is "Games", which apps drove more than 1 million ratings? (Hint: you may need to change your value calculation).

Add a second instance of the Sum of Total Ratings field, and use conditional formatting to visualize the values for high-volume game apps as data bars, with no overlapping text

Add a new calculated column in the source data named "Rating Improvement" (Current Version Avg Rating - Avg Rating).

Among high-volume Entertainment apps specifically, which app saw the largest rating improvement with the current version?

Did any of these apps see a decline with the current version? If so, what did the rating drop to?
