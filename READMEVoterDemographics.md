Using the PivotTable created in the U.S. Voters case study, complete the following:

How many states had a Voter Population % below 55%? Which states?

How many confirmed voters in California were over 65 years old in 2012? What percentage does that represent out of the total confirmed voters in California? What percentage out of the confirmed voters in the entire country?

Show both Citizen Population and Confirmed Voters by Age, as % of Column Total. What percentage of the citizen population do 45 to 64 year olds represent? What percentage of the confirmed voter population?   

Create a new calculated field named "Voter Turnout" (Confirmed Voters/Registered Voters), formatted as a percentage with 2 decimal points. Which state had the highest voter turnout rate? What about among 18-24 year old voters specifically?

As a politician seeking to improve voter turnout rates among young adults (18-24), which particular states would you target first?
