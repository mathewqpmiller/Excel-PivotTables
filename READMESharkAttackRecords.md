Using the PivotTable created in the Shark Attack case study, complete the following:

Show the count of attacks by country -- which 3 countries had the highest number of reported attacks over the past 5 years (2012-2016)? During this period, what % of reported attacks occurred in Spain?

Drag the "Area" field to the PivotTable row labels, change the Report Layout to Outline, and filter to show the top 5 areas by count of Case Number, by country. Where in South Africa were shark attacks most frequently reported over these 5 years?

Replace "Area" with "Type" and show the Count of Case Number values as % of Parent Total for each country. What % of attacks in New Zealand were unprovoked? How many cases?

Filter the Pivot for the USA only, and create a PivotChart to show the count of shark attacks by "Area". Use a column chart, and hide all field buttons. Try changing the chart type to a Donut or Bar Chart instead.

Remove the Year filter to show records from the full sample. What was Darren Good doing when he was attacked? When did this happen? (Note: I did not edit this record).
