Using the PivotTable created in the San Francisco Salaries case study, complete the following:

Filter and sort the Pivot to show the 5 employees who earned the highest Base Pay in 2011. Who were they?

Add a calculated field named "% Other Pay" (Other Pay/Total Pay), formatted as a percentage with 1 decimal. How many job titles earned only Other pay in 2012?

Among employees with >=$100k Base Pay in 2012, Did any employee earn more than 50% of their salary from Other Pay? If so, who?

Clear all filters and pull in Job Category and Job Title as row labels (Titles sorted alphabetically), then group any titles including the word "Curator" into a new category called "Curator". How many employees held some sort of Curator position in either 2012 or 2013? Among those, who earned the highest average base pay?
