Utilizing the data set "Analyzing San Francisco Salary Data" from the case studies file, I answered these four questions.

Who were the top five earners in 2011 in the category of Base Pay?

* e. Kenneth A Lombardi - $239,247

Create a calculated field named "% Other Pay", which is comprised of "Other Pay/Total Pay", and show which job titles made only "Other Pay" in 2012.
Job Titles	                                    Sum of Other Pay	Sum of Total Pay	Sum of % Other Pay
* a. Warehouse Worker	                        $3,370	            $3,370	            100.0%

3) In 2012, out of the employees who made $100k or more, which employee earned more than 50% of their pay from "Other Pay"?
a. Anna L Cuthbertson - $116,478 - 51%

4) In 2012 and 2013, how many employees held some sort of "Curator" position? Of those employees, who earned the top average base pay?
Clear all filters and pull in Job Category and Job Title as row labels (Titles sorted alphabetically), then group any titles including the word "Curator" into a new category called "Curator". How many employees held some sort of Curator position in either 2012 or 2013? Among those, who earned the highest average base pay?
