Insert a NEW PivotTable using the Baseball Team Stats data, and answer the following:

Create a view showing RS and RA by Team, then create calculated fields named "Net Runs" (RS - RA) and "HR per Game" (HR/G). Which team had the highest Net Run total over the entire sample? What about just the 2015 season?

Update the Pivot to show data for the Red Sox by year. Which years did they win the Division (DivWin)? The Wild Card (WCWin)? The World Series (WSWin)?

Show home runs (HR) by year, for the entire sample (all teams), and drag in a second instance as the % Difference From the previous year. In which season did overall home run totals decrease the most Y-o-Y?

Update your layout to show Net Runs and HR per Game as Values, Year as Row Labels, and Team (Full) as a Slicer. Select the Baltimore Orioles from the slicer, then insert a Pivot Chart formatted as a Combo Chart, with Net Runs plotted as columns on the primary axis, and HR per Game plotted as a line on the secondary axis. Do the two metrics follow a similar trend?
